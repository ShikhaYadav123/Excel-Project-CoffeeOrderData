# Excel-Project-CoffeeOrderData
An interactive excel dashboard created. I have created an excel dashboard using data about "Coffee Orders". Got the data from GitHub. The dataset was clean, only required minor updates. I have used formulas like NESTEDIF, XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH and Pivot tables for analysis purpose. 
The dashboard has timelines and slicers which are interconnected together through "Report connection" feature. This helps to reflect the information throughout the dashboard based on the selection in timelines/slicers.
